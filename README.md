# Phone-Service
You can add and remove people and change their names on the fly. I only had about 2 days to do this project so I couldn't focus on aesthetics or UI friendliness. My concerns where only to get it done. When you add a person to the directory, it stores them in the box below as a temporary object until all the objects' data has been entered such as the phone number and address. Then it moves into the actual phone book directory.
